# MidiDrums
Project in which a modified Guitar Hero drum, using Arduino, can be used as an electric Drum via a Unity App. Made as part of my final degree work for the degree in Computer Engineering.

The .ino file that needs to be loaded on the Arduino board can be found in the folder Arduino.
The rest of the project corresponds to the Unity App.
